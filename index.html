            Jean Augustine (née Simon), PC, CM, first Black female MP and Cabinet minister, social justice advocate,
            teacher, principal (born 9 September 1937 in Happy Hill, Grenada). Jean Augustine was a trailblazing
            politician and social activist: elected the first Black female Member of Parliament (1993), appointed the
            first Black woman in Cabinet (2002), and named first Fairness Commissioner by the Government of Ontario
            (2007). Her legacy includes the federal declaration of February as Black History Month, a motion she
            introduced in 1995.
            <br>
            In the mid-1990s, Jean Augustine played a crucial role in establishing Black History Month in Canada. Though
            individual communities had held celebrations as far back as the 1950s — e.g., in Halifax and Toronto — none
            existed federally. However, in 1979, the Ontario Black History Society made significant headway when it
            convinced the City of Toronto to formally declare February as Black History Month. In 1993, the Society
            successfully petitioned the Ontario government to declare a province-wide celebration. Motivated by this
            victory, they approached Augustine about extending Black History Month across the nation. Augustine
            enthusiastically supported the idea. As she mentioned to the Canadian Museum for Human Rights.
